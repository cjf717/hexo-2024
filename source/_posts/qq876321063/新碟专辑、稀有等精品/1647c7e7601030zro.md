ülo Krigul studied in Tallinn and Vienna, and has written
music in a wide variety of genres. Three works presented here – And
the Sea Arose, Aga vaata aina üles ("But Look Always Up") and
liquid turns – were completed in 2019-2020 when Krigul was
composer-in-residence with the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber
Choir.
Linked by a common concept and the recycling of musical
material, the three form a triptych-like set, here preceded by Vesi
ise ("Water Is") from 2015. The latter is the first piece that
Krigul wrote for the choir and its conductor Kaspars Putni?? and
includes ideas that has been carried over into their later
collaboration. If Vesi ise here functions as a prelude, liquid
turns is to an extent a summation of the programme: the composer
has sampled text and music from the two preceding works and random
phrases interact and emerge as a new whole. Krigul has chosen his
texts from the New Testament, the writings of the philosopher Uku
Masing and the sound poetry of Ilmar Laaban. ? BIS Records
