# EijiOue／MinnesotaOrchestra-ExoticDancesfromtheOpera／24bit／176.4khz[FLAC]

简介 · · · · · ·
"A sonic spectacular. The orchestra sounds full, natural,
warm, and nicely spread out over the soundstage. There is none of
the glare that still seems to affect many orchestral digital
recordings; even the highest register of the violins sounds smooth
and musical. Climaxes are never congested, and the fullest textures
still retain clarity ... this is simply to enjoy." -- Fanfare
Amazing high resolution sound on a deluxe hybrid SACD of favorites
and rarities, including Saint-Sa?ns' Bacchanale, Strauss' Dance of
the Seven Veils, and Rabaud's Dances from Marouf. This collection
of wonderful performances from the Minnesota Orchestra has been a
perennial favorite and best seller on CD, and can now be heard on
SACD! This recording is one of legendary engineer "Prof." Keith
Johnson's very best. Also includes HDCD encoding on CD layer for
highest audiophile quality.
