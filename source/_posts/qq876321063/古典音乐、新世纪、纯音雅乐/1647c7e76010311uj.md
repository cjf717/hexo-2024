# 舒伯特鳟鱼五重奏发烧古典SACD[ISO]

EA-988. 舒伯特《 鳟鱼五重奏
发烧古典SACD》[WAV+CUE]
专辑简介：
舒伯特鳟鱼五重奏 维也纳八重奏
Schubert:The "Trout" Quintet - Curzon/Winer Oktett
克利福德?柯曾（Clifford Curzon）
《CD圣经》"克利福德?柯曾（Clifford
Curzon）舒伯特《鳟鱼》是历史上最著名的五重奏，弹奏钢琴的这一个版本亦最具权威性，它的母带嘶声颇大，而高低频伸延度也少了一截，但弦乐和钢琴仍然充满动感和音乐味，整体音色温暖厚润，听感令人舒服悠然，听不了两分钟，耳朵就自动滤除了背景的嘶声和杂声，只将音乐的精粹一一接收。"
曾被诟病的母带噪音问题，经 Analogue Productions 重制后，得到非常美满的改善，AP重制版被公认（Clifford
Curzon）舒伯特《鳟鱼》历来最佳版本
Mastered by Willem Makee
"The Vienna Octet's remake, recorded with Sir Clifford Curzon in
1957 when Boskovsky was still leading, is one of those gramophone
classics difficult to knock off its perch." — Gramophone
In the summer of 1819, Franz Schubert stayed in the Austrian town
of Steyr where he began work on the composition of the
five-movement Piano Quintet in A major, op. 114 (D 667) which was
commissioned by the cellist Sylvester Paumgartner. The work was
completed in the autumn and soon achieved great popularity under
the name of Trout Quintet, which it owes to the Andantino fourth
movement — a set of variations on the song of the same name.
The work has remained highly popular right up to the present day
and so it comes as no surprise to find this highly praised
recording, made with such renowned artists as the pianist Clifford
Curzon, the violinist Willi Boskovsky and other members of the
Vienna Octet, being reissued.
The ensemble's refreshing performance reflects the sparkling
lightness and virtuosity of the work. The well-balanced recording
with its full tone certainly deserves a place in every music lovers
collection.
