Review by Thom Jurek [-]
Finally, in 2004, Americans had the domestic CD issue of Nana
Mouskouri's stateside debut album -- The Girl From Greece Sings
from 1962. This particular edition was released in France in 2000
in the Original Fontana Masters series. While Mouskouri has become
an international star, and one whose name is associated with
everything from pop to stylized renditions of folk songs to
classical lieder, this collection of tunes, produced by Quincy
Jones, who was then artistic director at Mercury, was strictly in
the American idiom, chock-full of tunes associated with jazz and
the generation's pop singers. The tunes were arranged by orchestra
conductor Torrie Zito, Al Cohn, and Charles Albertine and the sound
engineer on these sessions was none other than Phil Ramone. The 12
original cuts include very wonderfully stylized and esoteric
readings of "That's My Desire," "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me,"
"What's Good About Goodbye," "What Now My Love," and stunning
versions of "Love Me or Leave Me" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes."
Mouskouri's voice, though sweet, was throatier than most American
ones. And she had the strength and range of an opera singer who
could moan like a blues singer -- "Love Me or Leave Me" is riveting
for this. But there is something else too: one can feel Jones
drawing her out and into the material. It is not as confident as it
would become later and is all the more compelling for its sense of
coming to inhabit it with confidence and authority. There are three
bonus tracks on the CD that come from these sessions, readings of
Lerner & Loewe's "Almost Like Being in Love," the Gershwins'
"But Not for Me," and a wonderfully perverse take of Cole Porter's
"I Get a Kick out of you." It's easy to hear why they didn't make
the original sessions, but they add dimension to it after the fact.
For Mouskouri fans in the U.S., this will be a welcome addition to
the catalog. For fans of great song interpreters -- Brel, Trenet,
Walker, Chris Connor, etc. -- this one will be something from left
field that will prove strange, wonderful, and alluring.
